# AWS Cost and Usage Insights Mod

[Tailpipe](https://tailpipe.io) is an open-source CLI tool that allows you to collect logs and query them with SQL.

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

The [AWS Cost and Usage Insights Mod](https://hub.powerpipe.io/mods/turbot/tailpipe-mod-aws-cost-and-usage-insights) contains pre-built dashboards which can be used to monitor and analyze costs across your AWS accounts using [Cost and Usage Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/table-dictionary-cur2.html).
